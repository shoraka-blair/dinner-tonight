# Basic React/Redux Crud Practice Example

This basic example is a practice example of creating a simple crud application
with React/Redux and a RESTFUL API

The project is divided into two directories, the api directory is the API Application and
the web directory is the React/Redux Application.

You can run both the API and WEB by doing the following

```
npm install
npm run web-install
npm run api-install
npm start
```

This should start the web app on 3000 and the api app on 5000
